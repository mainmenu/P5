\paragraph{Hardware in the device} 

In the following chapter we will see what hardware we have used to produce this device.
First we decided on what platform we will be working on.
Since we were allready familiar with the Raspberry Pi singleboard computer we decided that it is best to continue with the system we are allready know how to operate.
At first we used the Raspberry Pi 2 model B but in concideration of the power supply and performance we swapped it out with a Raspberry Zero.
