\section{Perspective}

In future perspective of this project we see that it is good to build the whole cube.
When the whole cube has been designed and built we see different uses for the system.
For example reaction wheel based movement can be used for interplanetary exploration on data collecting robots.
Because if the desired robot can move around different surfaces without having any external moving parts it is much more environment proof.
It can be used in harsh conditions.

If the project would be carried on in upcoming semesters then we propose to look more in/depth
