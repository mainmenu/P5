\section{Initiating Problem}
In this paper we focus on the development of a nonlinear controller for an unbalanced system.
Our unbalanced system in this case is one side of a cube, what is moved by and reaction wheel.
The problem with this system is that if it is set to it's balancing position the cube wants to get to a lower energy position.
Lower energy position in this case is that the cube lies down on one side.
Since we want it to keep upright we need to make a controller to hold it in the balancing position.

Complexity of the device comes where we have to check the angle of the tilt at all time and then apply correct torque to the motor.
Because the angle changes all the time thus we need to recalculate the torque after every reading aswell.
