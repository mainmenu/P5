\section{Assumptions}
In order to theoretically model the system we must make some assumptions which are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The breaking system works nearly ideal
 \item The accelerometer works without huge error 
 \item The base of the system is static with respect to the ground
 \item The system is able to rotate around the pivot point freely 
 \item DC motor is able to change its speed and direction fairly quickly
\end{itemize}
While modelling the system these assumptions must be kept in mind in order to design the best possible solution.
