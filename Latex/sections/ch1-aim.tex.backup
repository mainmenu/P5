\section{Aims of the project}
The aim of this project is to build a prototype for a cube that jumps up and balances on one of its corners.
More specifically the aims are listed below

\begin{itemize}
 \item Build a simulation model for this specific system
 \item build the real plant of this system
 \item Determination of system parameters
 \item Design a linear controller for the system
 \item Design a nonlinear controller for the system
 \item Impliment the designed controller on the real plant and evaluate the results
\end{itemize}
In the end of this paper we can hopefully give a positive answer to all of those points described above.
We have fully understood that the amount of work and dedication needed to fulfil these goals is quite big.
The biggest and most important goal is to learn and understand the controlling of the system and be able to implement that knowledge on fututre tasks.
