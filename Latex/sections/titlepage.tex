}{% the abstract

In the paper at hand we introduce a cube shaped system, what can jump up from the edge and then balance itself on the corner.
Movement of the system has been made possible by an embedded momentun wheel what can rotate on high angular velocities to move the cube.
Mainly we can see the development of the prototype for one side of the cube.
When the prototype is made to jump up it starts to balance itself on the edge by controlling the motor torque with a nonlinear controller.
Mainly we focus on the theoretical side of the controller.
