\section{Hypothesis}

In our project we are concentrating on the reaction wheel moving the devices body by changing the acceleration of the reaction wheel.
We will be constructing on one side of the cube and will place a reaction wheel in the middle of it.
Reaction wheel is there to make the "cube" jump up and then balance on one of its corners.
Our hypothesis is that the wheel will be able to store enough energy to jump, when stopped and will be able to balance the system on one of its corners just by altering the torque produced by the wheel.

In order to change the torque and balance the system the controller devolped have to be as fast as possible.
One of our hypothesis is that a linear controller would have more overshoot and it would be slower.
Only way to find it out is to model both of them.
Since we have a physical limit on the maximum speed and torque of the motor we must be awere that from certain angle the motor may not be sufficient enough to push the system in upright position again.
