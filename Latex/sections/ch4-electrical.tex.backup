\section{Electrical design}

In previous sectrion we looked at what could be the possible solution for the mechanical part of the system.
In the current section we are considering the electronical parts that should be used inside the device inhand.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Aluminium square plate with dimensions of 15x15 cm and holes inside for the reaction wheel mount and to keep the weight low as possible.
 \item Reaction wheel made out of aluminium. Wheel itself is a circle with spokes and a hole in the middle to mount it on the brushless DC motor.
 \item Tabletop mount what can be fixed to one of the corners of the prototype by bearings to have the least amount of friction as possible.
\end{itemize}
