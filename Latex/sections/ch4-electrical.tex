\section{Electrical design}

In previous section we looked at what could be the possible solution for the mechanical part of the system.
In the current section we are considering the electronical parts that should be used inside the device inhand.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Brushless DC motor EC 45 flat 50W from maxon
 \item Maxon escon 36/e EC servo controller driver
 \item Raspberry Pi 2B microcontroller for its fast processor and fast prototyping capability
 \item Accelerometer MPU 9150
 \item RC servo HSG-5084MG for the breaking system
 \item Embedded hall sensor on the motor for reading the wheel speed
\end{itemize}

Items listed above should be enough to implement the designed controller for the system.
If there are any shortcomings of the electronics they will be dealt with while building the system.
