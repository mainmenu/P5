\section{Build of the system}

In order to to implement the controller, what we have been designing in the duration of this project we must build an actual prototype for the system.
Problably the best way to do it is to take into consideration of the previously done projects.
Since we have been studyng thoroughly the project made by the ETH students\cite{cubli12}.
For the prototype we would be constructing only one side of the whole cube.

Base of the prototype will be a square shaped aluminium plate, in what we would have hole in the middle to mount the motor with the reaction wheel.
Reaction wheel it self would be a round wheel with three spoke.
The ideal solution for the prototype is shown on the figure below.
