\section{Model of jump up}
In our system it is crutial that we get the cube to jump up from the ground to the edge.
In this section we are looking the theory behind the jumping motion.


First we look at the equations for rotational kinetic energy of the wheel and potential energy of the whole system. 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kinetic rotational energy}
  E_{KR}= \frac{1}{2}I_{\omega }\dot{\Theta_{\omega }}^{2}
\end{equation}
Inertia of the wheel is described as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:moment of inertia of the wheel}
  I_{\omega }=m_{\omega }r^{2}
\end{equation}
The potential and kinetic energy we are looking for is the difference between the two states(when the cube is on one side and when on edge).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:potential energy difference}
  E_{pot}={E_{pot}}''-{E_{pot}}'
\end{equation}
Potential energy described on one side.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:first potential energy}
  {E_{pot}}'=mgh=(m_{w}+m_{b})gl
\end{equation}
Potential energy described on the edge.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq second potential energy}
  {E_{pot}}''=mgh\sqrt{2}=(m_{w}+m_{b})gl\sqrt{2}
\end{equation}
Now whe take in to concideration that our system has ideal breaking system and the whole kinetic energy of the wheel is transformed into the potential energy of the whole system.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wheel kinetic energy transformed into cubes potential energy}
  E_{KR}=E_{pot}
\end{equation}
Now we combine the equations
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:combination of all the previous equations}
  \frac{1}{2}m_{w}r^{2}\dot{\Theta_{w}}^{2}=(m_{w}+m_{b})g(l\sqrt{2}-l)
\end{equation}
And finally whe take on to the one side of the equation all that we need.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq square of the speed needed for the cube to jump in position}
  \dot{\Theta_{w}}^{2}=\frac{2(\sqrt{2}-1)(m_{w}+m_{b})gl}{m_{w}r^{2}}
\end{equation}
$E_{KR}$ is the kinetic energy of the wheel.
$E_{pot}$, $E_{pot}'$ and $E_{pot}''$ are the potential energies used in the model.
$m_{w}$ is the mass of the wheel.
$m_{b}$ is the mass of the whole system without the wheel.
$l$ is the lenght from the pivot point to the center of the mass.
$g$ is the gravitational pull.
$\dot{\Theta_{w}}$ is the rotational speed of the wheel.
$r$ is the radius of the wheel.
